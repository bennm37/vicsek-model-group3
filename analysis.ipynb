    "**The Flock Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our main class, from which many different types of bird such as moth,prey and predator inherit. When initialised it creates uniformly random positions in a (frame_size,frame_size) frame where frame_size is given in number of radiuses, and random directions with angle uniformly distributed in $[0,2\\pi)$. We interact with it mainly through the display methods such as display_state, animate_movement, and plot_order_stat. The main internal method is update_posdirs which syncronously updates positions and directions according to the Vicsek Model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementing Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "To wrap the frame we used a method suggested by Dr Henkes. By tiling the birds positions together we create two 3d arrays, one tiling the list of positions horizontally and the other vertically. By subtracting the two 3d arrays we create an array of the pairwise vectors between each bird (Flock.pvec()). This function is not disimilar to pdist in scipy.special.distance() with the difference being that the array we create is of vectors not distances. From this we can then calculate if each component of each vector is bigger than (L/2), where L is the frame size. If this is true we then recalculate the component now being itself modulo the frame size, effectively wrapping the vectors the other way round the torus the birds lie on. \n",

These update like normal vicsek birds but with an additional attraction or repulsion factor, calculated by $\\frac{1}{|v|}v$ where $v$ is a vector between predator and prey. This vectorises nicely in a similar way to Flock.pvec. Through vectorising all operations we were able to make this update in real time for an interactive animation in which the birds follow or run from the cursor. To see the Moth functionality press m, and Prey functionality press p. To change the background colour press b.\n"
